# 🛒 Exploratory Data Analysis on E-Commerce Data
**📊 Insights into Retail Transactions**

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project dives into the **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** of real-world e-commerce data from a **UK-based online retailer**.
It includes detailed transaction-level information such as:

🧾 Invoice details | 🛍 Product quantities | 💰 Unit prices | 👤 Customer IDs | 🕒 Date & time

---

The goal: Clean, transform, and analyze the data to uncover patterns that support **business decision-making** in areas like:

📦 Inventory planning • 🧠 Customer segmentation • 📈 Sales strategy


## 🎯 Objectives

- 🧼 Clean messy data and prepare it for analysis  
- 📉 Analyze revenue, sales performance, and trends  
- 👥 Understand customer behavior and spending patterns  
- 🕒 Extract time-based insights (daily, monthly, hourly)  
- 📈 Visualize trends to generate actionable insights

---

## 🧹 Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

- ❌ **Missing Values**: Removed or filled missing customer and product data  
- ⚠️ **Outlier Removal**: Filtered out rows with negative quantities  
- 🧮 **Feature Engineering**:
  - `Amount_Spent = Quantity × UnitPrice`
  - Extracted `Year`, `Month`, `Day`, `Hour` from `InvoiceDate`

---
