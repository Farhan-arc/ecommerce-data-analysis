# Exploratory Data Analysis on E-Commerce Data: Insights into Retail Transactions
Project Overview

In this project, I performed an in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on an e-commerce dataset containing actual transaction records from a UK-based retailer. The dataset includes transactional details such as product quantities, prices, customer IDs, and more, providing valuable insights into customer behavior, sales trends, and product performance.

The primary goal was to clean, transform, and analyze the data to uncover meaningful patterns and answer key business questions. By using various data analysis and visualization techniques, I was able to provide actionable insights that could drive business decisions in areas like product inventory management, customer segmentation, and sales forecasting.
Key Insights and Analysis

. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
. Handled Missing Values: Identified and addressed missing data across columns to ensure data integrity.
.Outlier Removal: Discovered and removed negative quantities in the dataset that were likely errors in transaction recording.
.Feature Engineering: Created a new column Amount_Spent by calculating the total money spent in each transaction, giving us a clearer picture of sales trends.
